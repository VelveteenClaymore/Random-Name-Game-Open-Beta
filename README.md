# Random-Name-Game-Open-Beta
Open beta for a side project. It's a random number guessing game that insults you, regardless of how long it took you to guess correctly.

# Relevant Info
The first feature-complete version of this idea of a single-player web game which is open to the public for testing. 
Date of Initial Upload: 01/04/2022
Version Requirements: Internet connection required to display some imagery. Currently only tested for the Google Chrome browser. No external JavaScript libraries necessary. Currently utilizing JavaScript ES2015, HTML5, and CSS3. Recommended to use Visual Studio Code with the Live Server extension to play it, as compatibility with other environments is not guaranteed. Although it does work by simply launching it with the Google Chrome Browser.
Synopsis: This project is now in the open beta version of development. As such, the source code will be public and open to pull requests in order to improve any aspect of it. As the developer, I must say that this is my first project in web development, so a lot of improvements can be made. As for the game itself, you simply guess a number between the given range and get insulted based on the number of tries it takes you. It also has a dynamic leaderboard to display top scores. In future, this project might scale to be used in a framework environment, although that might be overkill for such a simple program.
TL;DR: This program welcomes pull requests for its continued improvement.

# Update to Version 1.1
Duplicate Check Implementation
Date of Initial Upload: 01/21/2022
Version Requirements are the same.
Synopsis: Small changes were made to button displays, mainly how they scaled to smaller windows. The main change of this update was the addition of logic that checks whether an entry is a duplicate of a previous entry. If so, it prevents those duplicates from counting against the user. This system works but is open for improvements. Future updates will be more focused on aesthetic.
TL:DR: If you put the same answer twice, it doesn't count against you now.
