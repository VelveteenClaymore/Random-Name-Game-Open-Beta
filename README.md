Date of Initial Upload: 01/04/2022
Version Requirements: Internet connection required to display some imagery. Currently only tested for the Google Chrome browser. No external JavaScript libraries necessary. Currently utilizing JavaScript ES2015, HTML5, and CSS3. Recommended to use Visual Studio Code with the Live Server extension to play it, as compatibility with other environments is not guaranteed. Although it does work by simply launching it with the Google Chrome Browser.
Synopsis: This project is now in the open beta version of development. As such, the source code will be public and open to pull requests in order to improve any aspect of it. As the developer, I must say that this is my first project in web development, so a lot of improvements can be made. As for the game itself, you simply guess a number between the given range and get insulted based on the number of tries it takes you. It also has a dynamic leaderboard to display top scores. In future, this project might scale to be used in a framework environment, although that might be overkill for such a simple program.
TL;DR: This program welcomes pull requests for its continued improvement.

# Current Version: Open Beta v1.0
